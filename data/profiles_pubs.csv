However, it is unknown to what extent out-of-office BP derived via ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) increases over time, and which participant characteristics and risk factors might contribute to these increases. METHODS: We assessed 25-year change in office- and ABPM-derived BP across sex, race, diabetes mellitus (DM), and body mass index (BMI) subgroups in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study using multivariable-adjusted linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: We included 288 participants who underwent ABPM at the Year 5 Exam (mean [SD] age, 25.1 [3.7]; 45.8% men) and 455 participants who underwent ABPM at the Year 30 Exam (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [3.7]; 42.0% men).

Importance: High blood pressure (BP) during sleep (asleep blood pressure) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but a national prevalence estimate of masked asleep hypertension (high BP while sleeping but without high BP measured in the clinic [clinic BP]) for the United States is lacking. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of masked asleep hypertension among US adults by using BP thresholds from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) and the 2017 American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) BP guidelines. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort analysis pooled data from 3000 participants in 4 US population-based studies that conducted 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and 17969 participants in the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) without ABPM. Masked asleep hypertension status in NHANES was imputed using a 2-stage multiple imputation process. Data were collected from 2000 to 2016 and analyzed from March 4, 2019, to June 29, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: High clinic BP was defined as clinic systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) of at least 140/90 mm Hg using JNC7 and at least 130/80 mm Hg using 2017 ACC-AHA guidelines. High asleep BP was defined as mean asleep SBP/DBP of at least 120/70 mm Hg for JNC7 and at least 110/65 mm Hg for the 2017 ACC-AHA guidelines. Masked asleep hypertension was defined as high asleep BP without high clinic BP. Results: For the 3000 pooled cohort participants, the mean (SD) age was 52.0 (12.0) years, and 62.6% were women. For the 17 969 NHANES participants, the mean (SD) age was 46.7 (17.5) years, and 51.8% (weighted) were women. The estimated prevalence of masked asleep hypertension among US adults was 18.8% (95% CI, 16.7%-20.8%; 44.4 million US adults) using the JNC7 guideline and 22.7% (95% CI, 20.6%-24.8%; 53.7 million US adults) using the 2017 ACC-AHA guideline criteria. The prevalence of masked asleep hypertension was higher among older adults (aged ≥65 years, 24.4% [95% CI, 20.7%-28.0%]), men (27.0% [95% CI, 24.1%-29.9%]), non-Hispanic Black individuals (28.7% [95% CI, 25.4%-32.0%]), those who were taking antihypertensives (24.4% [95% CI, 21.1%-27.8%]), those who had masked daytime hypertension (44.7% [95% CI, 40.1%-49.3%]), and those with diabetes (27.6% [95% CI, 23.5%-31.8%]), obesity (24.3% [95% CI, 21.8%-26.9%]), or chronic kidney disease (21.5% [95% CI, 17.3%-25.6%]) using the 2017 ACC-AHA guideline. An estimated 11.9% of US adults (28.2 million) had isolated masked asleep hypertension (masked asleep hypertension but without high awake BP) using JNC7 guideline criteria, as did an estimated 13.3% (31.5 million) using 2017 ACC-AHA guideline criteria.

Purpose: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining exercise (EX) and resveratrol to treat older adults with physical function limitations. Methods: Three-arm, two-site pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) for community-dwelling adults (N = 60), 71.8 ± 6.3 years of age with functional limitations. Participants were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of (1) EX + placebo [EX0], (2) EX + 500 mg/day resveratrol [EX500], or (3) EX + 1000 mg/day resveratrol [EX1000]. EX consisted of two sessions a week for 12 weeks of center-based walking and whole-body resistance training. Safety was assessed through adverse events and feasibility through exercise session and supplement (placebo, or resveratrol) protocol adherence. Outcome measures included a battery of indices of physical function as well as skeletal muscle mitchondrial function. Data were adjusted for age and gender using the Intent-To-Treat approach. Results: Adverse event frequency and type were similar between groups (n = 8 EX0, n = 12 EX500, and n = 7 EX1000). Overall, 85% of participants met the supplement adherence via pill counts while 82% met the exercise session adherence. Adjusted within group mean differences (95% confidence interval) from week 0 to 12 for gait speed ranged from −0.04 (EX0: −0.1, 0.03) m/s to 0.04 (EX1000: −0.02, 0.11) and the six-minute walk test mean differences were 9.45 (EX0: −9.02, 27.7), 22.9 (EX500: 4.18, 41.6), and 33.1 (EX1000: 13.8, 52.4) meters. Unadjusted mean differences for citrate synthase were −0.80 (EX0: −15.45, 13.84), −1.38 (EX500: −12.16, 9.39), and 7.75 (EX1000: −4.68, 20.18) mU/mg. COX activity mean within group changes ranged from −0.05 (EX0) to 0.06 (EX500) k/s/mg. Additional outcomes are detailed in the text. Conclusion: The pilot RCT indicated that combined EX + resveratrol was safe and feasible for older adults with functional limitations and may improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and mobility-related indices of physical function.

EX consisted of two sessions a week for 12 weeks of center-based walking and whole-body resistance training. Safety was assessed through adverse events and feasibility through exercise session and supplement (placebo, or resveratrol) protocol adherence. Outcome measures included a battery of indices of physical function as well as skeletal muscle mitchondrial function. Data were adjusted for age and gender using the Intent-To-Treat approach. RESULTS: Adverse event frequency and type were similar between groups (n = 8 EX0, n = 12 EX500, and n = 7 EX1000). Overall, 85% of participants met the supplement adherence via pill counts while 82% met the exercise session adherence. Adjusted within group mean differences (95% confidence interval) from week 0 to 12 for gait speed ranged from -0.04 (EX0: -0.1, 0.03) m/s to 0.04 (EX1000: -0.02, 0.11) and the six-minute walk test mean differences were 9.45 (EX0: -9.02, 27.7), 22.9 (EX500: 4.18, 41.6), and 33.1 (EX1000: 13.8, 52.4) meters. Unadjusted mean differences for citrate synthase were -0.80 (EX0: -15.45, 13.84), -1.38 (EX500: -12.16, 9.39), and 7.75 (EX1000: -4.68, 20.18) mU/mg. COX activity mean within group changes ranged from -0.05 (EX0) to 0.06 (EX500) k/s/mg. Additional outcomes are detailed in the text.

BACKGROUND Several atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors are associated with awake and nocturnal hypertension. METHODS We assessed the association between a composite ASCVD risk score and awake or nocturnal hypertension using data from participants aged 40–79 years who completed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at the Year 30 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study exam in 2015–2016 (n = 716) and the baseline Jackson Heart Study exam in 2000–2004 (n = 770). Ten-year predicted ASCVD risk was calculated using the Pooled Cohort risk equations. Awake hypertension was defined as mean awake systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mm Hg and nocturnal hypertension was defined as mean asleep SBP ≥120 mm Hg or DBP ≥70 mm Hg. RESULTS Among participants with a 10-year predicted ASCVD risk <5%, 5% to <7.5%, 7.5% to <10%, and ≥10%, the prevalence of awake or nocturnal hypertension as a composite outcome was 29.5%, 47.8%, 62.2%, and 69.7%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, higher ASCVD risk was associated with higher prevalence ratios for awake or nocturnal hypertension among participants with clinic-measured SBP/DBP <130/85 mm Hg but not ≥130/85 mm Hg. The C-statistic for discriminating between participants with vs. without awake or nocturnal hypertension was 0.012 (95% confidence interval 0.003, 0.016) higher when comparing a model with ASCVD risk and clinic-measured blood pressure (BP) together vs. clinic-measured BP without ASCVD risk.

RESULTS: Among participants with a 10-year predicted ASCVD risk <5%, 5% to <7.5%, 7.5% to <10%, and ≥10%, the prevalence of awake or nocturnal hypertension as a composite outcome was 29.5%, 47.8%, 62.2%, and 69.7%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, higher ASCVD risk was associated with higher prevalence ratios for awake or nocturnal hypertension among participants with clinic-measured SBP/DBP <130/85 mm Hg but not ≥130/85 mm Hg. The C-statistic for discriminating between participants with vs. without awake or nocturnal hypertension was 0.012 (95% confidence interval 0.003, 0.016) higher when comparing a model with ASCVD risk and clinic-measured blood pressure (BP) together vs. clinic-measured BP without ASCVD risk.

Currently recommended traditional spirometry outputs do not reflect the relative contributions of emphysema and airway disease to airflow obstruction. We hypothesized that machine-learning algorithms can be trained on spirometry data to identify these structural phenotypes. METHODS. Participants enrolled in a large multicenter study (COPDGene) were included. The data points from expiratory flow-volume curves were trained using a deep-learning model to predict structural phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on CT, and results were compared with traditional spirometry metrics and an optimized random forest classifier. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and weighted F-score were used to measure the discriminative accuracy of a fully convolutional neural network, random forest, and traditional spirometry metrics to phenotype CT as normal, emphysema-predominant (>5% emphysema), airway-predominant (Pi10 > median), and mixed phenotypes. Similar comparisons were made for the detection of functional small airway disease phenotype (>20% on parametric response mapping). RESULTS. Among 8980 individuals, the neural network was more accurate in discriminating predominant emphysema/airway phenotypes (AUC 0.80, 95%CI 0.79–0.81) compared with traditional measures of spirometry, FEV1/FVC (AUC 0.71, 95%CI 0.69–0.71), FEV1% predicted (AUC 0.70, 95%CI 0.68–0.71), and random forest classifier (AUC 0.78, 95%CI 0.77–0.79).

2326164,Journal article (Peer Reviewed),07/04/2020,,"Background Sleep characteristics and disorders are associated with higher blood pressure (BP) when measured in the clinic setting. Methods and Results We tested whether self-reported sleep characteristics and likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were associated with nocturnal hypertension and nondipping systolic BP (SBP) among participants in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study who completed 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring during the year 30 examination. Likelihood of OSA was determined using the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Global sleep quality, habitual sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and midsleep time were obtained from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Nocturnal hypertension was defined as mean asleep SBP ≥120 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥70 mm Hg. Nondipping SBP was defined as a decline in awake-to-asleep SBP <10%. Among 702 participants, the prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP was 41.3% and 32.5%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment including cardiovascular risk factors, the prevalence ratios (PRs) for nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP associated with high versus low likelihood of OSA were 1.32 (95% CI, 1.00-1.75) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02-1.68), respectively. The association between likelihood of OSA and nocturnal hypertension was stronger for white participants (PR: 2.09; 95% CI, 1.23-3.48) compared with black participants (PR: 1.11; 95% CI, 0.79-1.56).

Background: Nocturnal hypertension, defined by a mean asleep systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (BP) ≥120/70 mm Hg, and nondipping SBP, defined by an awake-to-asleep decline in SBP <10%, are each associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results: We developed predictive equations to identify adults with a high probability of having nocturnal hypertension or nondipping SBP using data from the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study (n=787), JHS (Jackson Heart Study) (n=1063), IDH (Improving the Detection of Hypertension) study (n=395), and MHT (Masked Hypertension) study (n=772) who underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Participants were randomized to derivation (n=2511) or validation (n=506) data sets. The prevalence rates of nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP were 39.7% and 44.9% in the derivation data set, respectively, and 36.6% and 44.5% in the validation data set, respectively. The predictive equation for nocturnal hypertension included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, neck circumference, height, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin/creatinine ratio, and clinic SBP and diastolic BP. The predictive equation for nondipping SBP included age, sex, race/ethnicity, waist circumference, height, alcohol use, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and albumin/creatinine ratio. Concordance statistics (95% CI) for nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP predictive equations in the validation data set were 0.84 (0.80–0.87) and 0.73 (0.69–0.78), respectively. Compared with reference models including antihypertensive medication use and clinic SBP and diastolic BP as predictors, the continuous net reclassification improvement (95% CI) values for the nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP predictive equations were 0.52 (0.35–0.69) and 0.51 (0.34–0.69), respectively.

OBJECTIVE Recent studies have suggested that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) only among individuals with concomitant hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed the association between prediabetes and CVD by hypertension status among 3,313 black adults in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) without diabetes or a history of CVD at baseline (2000–2004). Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c between 5.7 and 6.4% (39 and 46 mmol/mol). Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ‡140/90 mmHg and/or self-reported antihypertensive medication use. Participants were followed for incident CVD events and all-cause mortality through 31 December 2014. RESULTS Overall, 35% of JHS participants did not have prediabetes or hypertension, 18% had prediabetes alone, 22% had hypertension alone, and 25% had both prediabetes and hypertension. Compared with participants without either condition, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for CVD events among participants with prediabetes alone, hypertension alone, and both prediabetes and hypertension were 0.86 (95% CI 0.51, 1.45), 2.09 (1.39, 3.14), and 1.93 (1.28, 2.90), respectively. Among participants with and without hypertension, there was no association between prediabetes and an increased risk for CVD (0.78 [0.46, 1.34] and 0.94 [0.70, 1.26], respectively). No association was present between prediabetes and all-cause mortality among participants with or without hypertension.

The ORSF is an ensemble method for right-censored survival data that uses linear combinations of input variables to recursively partition a set of training data. Regularized Cox proportional hazard models are used to identify linear combinations of input variables in each recursive partitioning step. Benchmark results using simulated and real data indicate that the ORSF’s predicted risk function has high prognostic value in comparison to random survival forests, conditional inference forests, regression and boosting. In an application to data from the Jackson Heart Study, we demonstrate variable and partial dependence using the ORSF and highlight characteristics of its ten-year predicted risk function for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (AS-CVD; stroke, coronary heart disease). We present visualizations comparing variable and partial effect estimation according to the ORSF, the conditional inference forest, and the Pooled Cohort Risk equations. The obliqueRSF R package, which provides functions to fit the ORSF and create variable and partial dependence plots, is available on the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN).",,,,,,,"Jaeger BC, Leann Long D, Long DM, Sims M, Szychowski JM, Min YI, McClure LA, Howard G, Simon N",,,,10.1214/19-AOAS1261,,,1941-7330,,,,,,,1932-6157,3,Annals of Applied Statistics,,,,,,,,,,1847,1883,,,2019-09-01,Published,,,,,,,,,Oblique random survival forests,Journal Article,13,,,1,Annals of Applied Statistics (1932-6157),A*,Annals of Applied Statistics (1932-6157),1.5780,Annals of Applied Statistics (1932-6157),1.745,Annals of Applied Statistics (1932-6157),1.167,No,,green,02/04/2020 12:36:33,2-s2.0-85073799138,Scopus,Annals of Applied Statistics,SHERPA/RoMEO

The prevalence and prevalence ratios of LVH were calculated for high awake SBP (≥130 mmHg), high asleep SBP (≥110 mmHg), the cross-classification of high awake and asleep SBP, and nondipping SBP (percentage decline in awake-to-asleep SBP < 10%). Odds ratios for abnormal left ventricular geometry associated with these phenotypes were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 46.0 and 49.1% of study participants had high awake and asleep SBP, respectively, and 31.1% had nondipping SBP. After adjustment for demographics and clinical characteristics, high awake SBP was associated with a prevalence ratio for LVH of 2.79 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.63-4.79].

Importance: Little is known regarding health outcomes associated with higher blood pressure (BP) levels measured outside the clinic among African American individuals. Objective: To examine whether daytime and nighttime BP levels measured outside the clinic among African American individuals are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality independent of BP levels measured inside the clinic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 1034 African American participants in the Jackson Heart Study who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline (September 26, 2000, to March 31, 2004). Mean daytime and nighttime BPs were calculated based on measurements taken while participants were awake and asleep, respectively. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular disease events, including coronary heart disease and stroke, experienced through December 31, 2014, and all-cause mortality experienced through December 31, 2016, were adjudicated. The associations of daytime BP and nighttime BP, separately, with CVD events and all-cause mortality were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: A total of 1034 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [10.9] years; 337 [32.6%] male; and 583 [56.4%] taking antihypertensive medication) were included in the study. The mean daytime systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) was 129.4/77.6 mm Hg, and the mean nighttime SBP/DBP was 121.3/68.4 mm Hg. During follow-up (median [interquartile range], 12.5 [11.1-13.6] years for CVD and 14.8 [13.7-15.6] years for all-cause mortality), 113 CVD events and 194 deaths occurred. After multivariable adjustment, including in-clinic SBP and DBP, the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD events for each SD higher level were 1.53 (95% CI, 1.24-1.88) for daytime SBP (per 13.5 mm Hg), 1.48 (95% CI, 1.22-1.80) for nighttime SBP (per 15.5 mm Hg), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.51) for daytime DBP (per 9.3 mm Hg), and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06-1.59) for nighttime DBP (per 9.5 mm Hg).

Measurement of daytime and nighttime BP using ambulatory monitoring during a 24-hour period may help identify African American individuals who have an increased cardiovascular disease risk.",,"Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.",,,,,"Yano Y, Tanner RM, Sakhuja S, Jaeger BC, Booth JN, Abdalla M, Pugliese D, Seals SR, Ogedegbe G, Jones DW",,,,10.1001/jamacardio.2019.2845,,,2380-6591,,"pubmed:31411629, pmc:PMC6694386",,,,No,2380-6583,9,JAMA cardiology,"Humans, Cardiovascular Diseases, Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory, Prognosis, Incidence, Cause of Death, Survival Rate, Follow-Up Studies, Prospective Studies, Circadian Rhythm, Blood Pressure, Adult, Middle Aged, Outpatients, African Americans, United States, Female, Male, Young Adult",eng,,Print,,,,,,910,917,,,2019-09,Published,,,,,2019-08-15,,,,Association of Daytime and Nighttime Blood Pressure With Cardiovascular Disease Events Among African American Individuals.,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, research-article, Multicenter Study, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",4,,,2,,,,,,,,,No,,white,02/04/2020 12:49:20,MED:31411629,Europe PubMed Central,JAMA Cardiology,SHERPA/RoMEO

Importance: High-intensity statin use after myocardial infarction (MI) varies by patient characteristics, but little is known about differences in use by hospital or region. Objective: To explore the relative strength of associations of region and hospital and patient characteristics with high-intensity statin use after MI. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis used Medicare administrative claims and enrollment data to evaluate fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were hospitalized for MI from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2015, with a statin prescription claim within 30 days of discharge. Data were analyzed from January 4, 2017, through May 12, 2019. Exposures: Beneficiary characteristics were abstracted from Medicare data. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the 2014 American Hospital Association Survey and Hospital Compare quality metrics. Nine regions were defined according to the US Census. Main Outcomes and Measures: Intensity of the first statin claim after discharge characterized as high (atorvastatin calcium, 40-80 mg, or rosuvastatin calcium, 20-40 mg/d) vs low to moderate (all other statin types and doses).

Background: While there is a great deal of research updating methods for estimating renal function, many of these methods are being developed in either adults with CKD or younger children. Currently, there is limited understanding of the agreement between the modified new bedside Schwartz estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) formula and the adult CKD-EPI formula in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) measured longitudinally. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 242 patients (10-30 years) with CKD, followed retrospectively in a single tertiary centre as they transitioned from the paediatric- to adult-focused settings. The study population came from a longitudinal cohort of AYAs undergoing healthcare transition at the STARx Program at the University of North Carolina, in the South-Eastern USA, from 2006 to 2015. We calculated and compared the eGFR using the new bedside Schwartz formula and the CKD-EPI eGFR. Measurements were repeated for each age in years. Agreement was tested using Bland & Altman analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed using the following age groups 10-15, 15-20, 20-25 and 25-30 years, glomerular and non-glomerular causes of CKD and height z-score. Results: Using repeated measures, concordance between the new Schwartz and CKD-EPI eGFR was low at 0.74 (95% C.I. 0.67, 0.79) at the lowest age range of 10-15, 0.78 (95% C.I. 0.71, 0.84) at age 15-20, 0.80 (0.70, 0.87) at ages 20-25, and 0.82 (95% C.I. 0.70, 0.90) at age 25-30.

METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study of 242 patients (10-30 years) with CKD, followed retrospectively in a single tertiary centre as they transitioned from the paediatric- to adult-focused settings. The study population came from a longitudinal cohort of AYAs undergoing healthcare transition at the STARx Program at the University of North Carolina, in the South-Eastern USA, from 2006 to 2015.

The linear mixed model, sometimes referred to as the multi-level model, is one of the most widely used tools for analyses involving clustered data. Various definitions of R2 have been proposed for the linear mixed model, but several limitations prevail. Presently, there is no method to compute R2 for the linear mixed model that accommodates an interpretation based on variance partitioning, a method to quantify uncertainty and produce confidence limits for the R2 statistic, and a capacity to use the R2 statistic to conduct covariance model selection in a manner similar to information criteria. In this article, we introduce such an R2 statistic. The proposed R2 measures the proportion of generalized variance explained by fixed effects in the linear mixed model.

Purpose: Previous studies provided evidence for the validity of the PROMIS Pediatric measures in cross-sectional studies. This study evaluated the ability of the PROMIS Pediatric measures to detect change over time in children and adolescents with cancer, nephrotic syndrome (NS), or sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: Participants (8–17 years) completed measures of fatigue, pain interference, anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, mobility, upper extremity, and peer relationships at three or four time points (T1–T4). Between T1 and T2, children with cancer received chemotherapy and children with SCD experienced a pain exacerbation. Children with NS were first assessed during active disease (T2), with T3 and T4 conducted at disease remission. For the primary analysis of responsiveness, we expected better scores at T3 (recovery) compared to T2 (event) for all diseases. T1 and T4 are also expected to have better scores than T2.

Measuring the proportion of variance explained (R2) by a statistical model and the relative importance of specific predictors (semi-partial R2) can be essential considerations when building a parsimonious statistical model. The R2 statistic is a familiar summary of goodness-of-fit for normal linear models and has been extended in various ways to more general models. In particular, the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) extends the normal linear model and is used to analyze correlated (hierarchical), non-normal data structures. Although various R2 statistics have been proposed, there is no consensus in statistical literature for the most sensible definition of R2 in this context. This research aims to build upon existing knowledge and definitions of R2 and to concisely define the statistic for the GLMM. Here, we derive a model and semi-partial R2 statistic for fixed (population) effects in the GLMM by utilizing the penalized quasi-likelihood estimation method based on linearization. We show that our proposed R2 statistic generalizes the widely used marginal R2 statistic introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth, demonstrate our statistics capability in model selection, show the utility of semi-partial R2 statistics in longitudinal data analysis, and provide software that computes the proposed R2 statistic along with semi-partial R2 for individual fixed effects.

Body mass index, smoking, physical activity, diet, BP, cholesterol and glucose, categorized as ideal, intermediate, or poor according to the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 were assessed at baseline and used to define cardiovascular health. Incident aTRH was defined by uncontrolled BP, systolic BP ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg, while taking ≥3 classes of antihypertensive medication or controlled BP, systolic BP <130 mm Hg and diastolic BP <80 mm Hg, while taking ≥4 classes of antihypertensive medication at a follow-up visit. Over a median 9 years of follow-up, 605 (19.4%) participants developed aTRH. Incident aTRH developed among 25.8%, 18.2%, and 15.7% of participants with 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 5 ideal Life's Simple 7 components, respectively. No participants had 6 or 7 ideal Life's Simple 7 components at baseline. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident aTRH associated with 2 and 3 to 5 versus 0 to 1 ideal components were 0.75 (0.61-0.92) and 0.67 (0.54-0.82), respectively. These findings suggest optimizing cardiovascular health may reduce the pill burden and high cardiovascular risk associated with aTRH among individuals with hypertension.",,,,,,,"Akinyelure OP, Sakhuja S, Colvin CL, Clark D, Jaeger BC, Hardy ST, Howard G, Cohen LP, Irvin MR, Tanner R, Carey RM, Muntner P",,,,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15890,,,1524-4563,,pubmed:33131312,,,,,0194-911X,,Hypertension,,,,,,,,,,1953,1961,,,2020-01-01,Published,,,,,,,,,Cardiovascular Health and Transition from Controlled Blood Pressure to Apparent Treatment Resistant Hypertension: The Jackson Heart Study and the REGARDS Study,Journal Article,,,,0,Hypertension (0073-425X),A*,HYPERTENSION (0194-911X),6.8570,Hypertension (0194-911X),3.795,Hypertension (0194-911X),1.935,No,,yellow,02/04/2020 11:34:44,2-s2.0-85096085216,Scopus,Hypertension,SHERPA/RoMEO
